          <li>
            <span class="task-title">Remove visible weeds manually using a hoe or similar tool.</span>
            <p class="why-important">

            <span class="task-title">Apply a pre-emergent herbicide to the affected areas.</span>
            <p class="why-important">
              Why this is important: Pre-emergent herbicides are a powerful tool in weed management, as they prevent new weeds from growing. By applying a pre-emergent herbicide, you can reduce the overall weed population and prevent future weed growth.

            <span class="task-title">Monitor the affected areas regularly and remove any new weeds manually.</span>
            <p class="why-important">
              Why this is important: Monitoring the affected areas regularly is crucial in weed management, as it allows you to detect new weed growth early on and take action before the problem becomes worse.
